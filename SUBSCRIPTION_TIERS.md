## Free Tier

The Free tier provides a solid foundation for users to explore Ologywood's core features without financial commitment. This tier is ideal for independent artists just starting out or venues testing the platform.

### Features Included

Artists on the Free tier can create one limited artist profile with basic information including bio, genres, and contact details. They can create one basic rider template with essential technical and hospitality requirements. The platform allows two booking requests per month, sufficient for casual users to test the booking workflow. Basic contract management includes standard performance contracts with simple signing workflows.

The rider comparison tool on Free tier is limited to comparing two rider templates at a time, helping users understand the feature without full access. Basic rider acknowledgment workflow allows venues to acknowledge riders but with limited modification capabilities. Free users receive basic analytics showing booking metrics and rider acceptance rates.

PDF export is limited to one document per month, and email notifications are sent for critical events only (new bookings, contract signatures). Support access is limited to community forums and email with 48-hour response times. Free users cannot access the API, and team collaboration is limited to the individual account owner.

### Limitations

The analytics dashboard shows only basic metrics without trend analysis or detailed reporting. Rider templates are limited to one, and booking requests are capped at two per month to encourage upgrade.

### User Experience

Free tier users see upgrade prompts when they reach feature limits (e.g., "You've used your 2 monthly booking requests. Upgrade to Basic for unlimited requests"). The dashboard displays a banner highlighting premium features with a clear upgrade path. Support is primarily through community forums and email, with a 48-hour response time.

## Basic Tier
