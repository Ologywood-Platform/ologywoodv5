# Frequently Asked Questions: Contract Management

## General Questions

### Q: What is the contract management system?

### Q: Who can use the contract management system?
**A:** Both artists and venues can use the system. Artists can review and sign contracts, while venues can create and send contracts to artists.

### Q: Is there a cost to use the contract system?
**A:** The contract management system is included with your Ologywood subscription at no additional cost.

### Q: Are digital signatures legally binding?
**A:** Yes, digital signatures created through Ologywood are legally binding in most jurisdictions. However, we recommend consulting with a lawyer about the specific laws in your area.

### Q: Can I use my own contract templates?
**A:** Yes, you can customize the provided templates or upload your own contracts. Contact support for assistance with custom templates.

## Contract Signing Questions

### Q: How do I sign a contract?
**A:** Log in to your Artist Dashboard, go to the Contracts tab, find the contract you need to sign, click "View Contract", and then click "Sign Contract" at the bottom. Use the signature canvas to sign your name, then click "Submit Signature".

### Q: What if I make a mistake when signing?
**A:** You can click "Clear" to erase your signature and try again. If you've already submitted the signature and need to change it, contact the venue to cancel the contract and create a new one.

### Q: Can I sign a contract on my mobile device?
**A:** Yes, the contract signing interface is responsive and works on mobile devices. For the best experience, use a stylus or tablet.

### Q: How long does it take to sign a contract?
**A:** Signing typically takes 2-5 minutes. You can take as long as you need to review the contract before signing.

### Q: Do I need to sign in a specific way?
**A:** Your signature should be clear and distinct. Try to sign naturally, as you would on paper. Avoid signatures that are too small or faint.

### Q: What if I accidentally sign a contract I didn't mean to?
**A:** Contact the venue immediately. The contract can be cancelled and a new one created if needed.

### Q: Can someone else sign a contract on my behalf?
**A:** No, contracts must be signed by the actual party. Each signature is tied to the user account that signed it.

### Q: Is my signature secure?
**A:** Yes, signatures are encrypted and protected with cryptographic hashing. Each signature generates a unique digital certificate that proves authenticity.

## Digital Certificate Questions

### Q: What is a digital certificate?
**A:** A digital certificate is a unique identifier that proves your signature is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. It's automatically generated when you sign a contract.

### Q: How do I find my certificate number?
**A:** The certificate number appears on your signed contract and in the confirmation email you receive after signing.

### Q: How long is a certificate valid?
**A:** Certificates are valid for 365 days from the signing date. After that, they expire but can still be verified.

### Q: Can I verify a certificate without logging in?
**A:** Yes, anyone can verify a certificate using the public Certificate Verification page. You just need the certificate number.

### Q: What does "tampering detected" mean?
**A:** It means the signature or certificate has been modified after it was created. This is a serious issue and should be reported to support immediately.

### Q: What should I do if tampering is detected?
**A:** Contact the other party immediately, do not proceed with the contract, report it to support, and create a new contract to be re-signed.

### Q: Can I revoke a certificate?
**A:** Certificates cannot be revoked, but you can create a new contract if needed. Contact support for assistance.

## Reminder and Notification Questions

### Q: When will I receive reminders about my contract?
**A:** You'll receive automated reminders 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before your event. You can adjust reminder preferences in your settings.

### Q: Can I turn off reminders?
**A:** Yes, you can disable reminders in your notification preferences. However, we recommend keeping them enabled to avoid missing important dates.

**A:** Check your spam folder, verify your email address is correct, and ensure email notifications are enabled in your settings. Contact support if you continue to have issues.

### Q: Can I request a manual reminder?
**A:** Yes, venue managers can send manual reminders to artists from the Contracts dashboard.
