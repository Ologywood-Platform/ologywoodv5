## Article 4: Understanding Digital Certificates

### What is a Digital Certificate?

A digital certificate is a unique identifier that proves a signature is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. When you sign a contract, a digital certificate is automatically generated and attached to your signature.

### Certificate Information

Each certificate includes:

- **Certificate Number** - Unique identifier (e.g., SIG-2026-ABC123)
- **Signer Name** - Name of the person who signed
- **Signer Email** - Email address of the signer
- **Signed Date** - Exact date and time of signing
- **Expiration Date** - When the certificate expires (365 days)
- **Verification Hash** - Cryptographic proof of authenticity
- **Audit Trail** - Record of all verification events

### How Certificates Work

1. **Signature Capture** - Your signature is recorded digitally
2. **Cryptographic Hashing** - Your signature is converted to a unique hash
3. **Certificate Generation** - A digital certificate is created with your signature hash
4. **Timestamp** - The exact date and time is recorded
5. **Audit Trail** - All verification events are logged

### Why Certificates Matter

- **Legal Proof** - Proves you actually signed the contract
- **Authenticity** - Verifies the signature hasn't been altered
- **Compliance** - Meets legal requirements for digital signatures
- **Dispute Resolution** - Provides evidence in case of disagreements
- **Record Keeping** - Creates a permanent audit trail

### Certificate Validity

- Certificates are valid for **365 days** from the signing date
- After expiration, the certificate can still be verified but is marked as expired
- If you need to re-verify an expired certificate, contact support

### Next Steps

- Learn how to verify certificates
- Download your certificate
- Understand the audit trail

## Article 5: Verifying Contract Authenticity
