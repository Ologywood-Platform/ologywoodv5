## Using Templates for Bookings

### When Venues Browse Your Profile

- Your primary rider template is visible to venues when they view your profile
- Venues can see all your requirements before deciding to book you

### When You Receive a Booking Request

- The booking request will reference your rider template
- Venues have acknowledged that they reviewed your requirements
- You can discuss any adjustments needed via the messaging system

### When You Confirm a Booking

- Both you and the venue have a clear understanding of expectations
- Your rider template serves as the reference document for the event

## Best Practices

### For Artists

1. **Be Realistic**: Only request what you genuinely need. Unrealistic demands make venues hesitant to book you.

2. **Prioritize**: Focus on your must-haves. If you're flexible on some items, mention that in special requests.

3. **Keep It Updated**: Update your template as your needs change. Different venues may require different setups.

4. **Be Specific**: Instead of "good sound system," specify "minimum 2kW PA system with 4-channel mixer."

5. **Communicate**: Use your template as a starting point for conversation, not as a rigid contract.

6. **Offer Alternatives**: For example, "Prefer wireless microphone, but wired is acceptable."

7. **Consider Venue Size**: Create different templates for different venue types:
   - Small clubs (minimal requirements)
   - Medium venues (standard requirements)
   - Large festivals (comprehensive requirements)

### For Venues Using Templates

1. **Review Early**: Check the rider when first considering an artist.

2. **Be Honest**: If you can't meet certain requirements, communicate that immediately.

3. **Plan Ahead**: Use the rider to prepare your venue and brief your staff.

4. **Confirm Details**: Follow up with the artist to confirm final arrangements.

5. **Create a Checklist**: Use the rider to create an event-day checklist for your team.
