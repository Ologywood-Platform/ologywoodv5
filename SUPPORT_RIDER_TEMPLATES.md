## For Artists

### Creating Your First Rider Template

#### Step 1: Access Rider Templates

Navigate to your Dashboard and select the **Riders** tab. Click the **Create New Rider** button to begin creating your first template.

#### Step 2: Fill in Basic Information

Start with the template name and description. These help venues quickly identify your rider type. For example:
- "Standard Rock Performance"
- "Intimate Acoustic Setup"
- "DJ Electronic Performance"

#### Step 3: Technical Requirements

Define your technical needs including:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| PA System Required | Whether you need sound reinforcement | Yes/No |
| Microphone Count | Number of microphones needed | 2-4 |
| Lighting Required | Stage lighting specifications | Yes/No |
| Stage Size | Minimum stage dimensions | 20x15 feet |
| Setup Time Required | Time needed before performance (minutes) | 60 |

#### Step 4: Hospitality Requirements

Specify your hospitality needs:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Dressing Room Required | Private space for preparation | Yes/No |
| Catering Provided | Meal requirements | Yes/No |
| Beverage Options | Specific drink preferences | Water, coffee, energy drinks |
| Parking Required | Vehicle parking spaces needed | Yes/No |
| Parking Spaces | Number of spaces | 2-3 |

#### Step 5: Travel & Accommodation

Detail your travel preferences:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Travel Accommodation | Hotel or lodging type | 4-star hotel |
| Performance Duration | How long your performance lasts | 60 minutes |

#### Step 6: Promotion & Merchandise

Specify promotion and merchandise policies:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Merchandise Allowed | Can you sell merchandise at venue | Yes/No |
| Promotion Requirements | Social media or marketing needs | Tag us in posts |

#### Step 7: Additional Notes

Add any special requirements or notes that don't fit other categories. This is where you can include unique requests or important information.

### Publishing Your Rider

Once you've filled in all required fields, click **Save & Publish**. Your rider is now visible to venues when they browse your profile or request bookings.

### Exporting Your Rider as PDF

To share your rider professionally:

1. Navigate to your Riders tab
2. Find the rider you want to export
3. Click the **Download PDF** button
4. The rider will be formatted as a professional document ready to share

### Managing Multiple Riders

You can create multiple riders for different performance types. For example:

- **Standard Rock Setup** - For typical rock performances
- **Acoustic Intimate** - For smaller venues
- **Festival Performance** - For large outdoor events

Venues will see all your riders and can compare them before selecting one for their booking.

### Monitoring Rider Performance

Access your **Rider Analytics** dashboard to track:

- **Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of venues that acknowledge your riders without modifications
- **Common Modifications**: Most frequently requested changes by venues
- **Negotiation Timeline**: Average time from rider sharing to acknowledgment
- **Template Performance**: Which riders are most popular with venues

Use these insights to optimize your riders. If a requirement is frequently modified, consider if it's realistic for typical venues.

## For Venues

### Browsing Artist Riders

When viewing an artist's profile, you'll see a **Review Artist Riders** section in the booking request dialog. Click **Show Riders** to view all available riders from that artist.

### Using the Rider Comparison Tool

The Rider Comparison Tool helps you understand artist requirements before committing to a booking.

#### How to Compare Riders

1. **Select Riders**: Check the boxes next to 2-4 riders you want to compare
2. **View Comparison**: The side-by-side grid shows all fields organized by category
3. **Identify Differences**: Green checkmarks indicate "Yes" requirements, red X's indicate "No"
4. **Assess Compatibility**: Determine if your venue can meet the requirements

#### Understanding the Comparison Display

| Color | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Green (✓) | Requirement is needed | Ensure your venue can provide |
| Red (✗) | Requirement is not needed | No action needed |
| Gray | Not specified | Contact artist for clarification |

### Selecting a Rider for Your Booking

Once you've reviewed the riders:

1. Click on the rider you want to select
2. A confirmation message appears: "Rider selected for this booking"
3. Proceed with your booking request
4. The selected rider is now linked to your booking

### Proposing Rider Modifications

If you cannot meet certain rider requirements, you can propose modifications:

1. After booking confirmation, navigate to the booking details
2. Click the **Rider Acknowledgment** section
3. Select **Propose Modifications**
4. For each requirement you want to modify:
   - Select the field
   - Explain why you cannot meet it
   - Propose an alternative if applicable
5. Submit your modification proposal

The artist will receive a notification and can approve, counter-propose, or reject your modifications.

### Tracking Modification Status

In your booking details, you'll see a **Modification Timeline** showing:

- When modifications were proposed
- Artist's responses (approved, counter-proposed, rejected)
- Current status of each requirement
- Complete negotiation history

## Rider Acknowledgment Workflow

### Understanding the Workflow

The Rider Acknowledgment Workflow ensures clear communication about performance requirements:

   ↓
3. Rider is Shared with Venue
   ↓
4. Venue Reviews & Acknowledges
   ↓
5. Negotiation (if needed)
   ↓
6. Final Agreement Reached
```

### Acknowledgment Status

| Status | Meaning | Next Step |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Pending | Venue hasn't reviewed rider | Venue reviews and acknowledges |
| Acknowledged | Venue accepts all requirements | Booking can proceed |

6. Submit your response
7. Venue receives notification and can respond

### For Venues: Responding to Counter-Proposals

If an artist counter-proposes:

1. Check your email notification or dashboard
2. Navigate to booking details → **Rider Acknowledgment**
3. Review the artist's counter-proposal
4. Choose to:
   - **Approve**: Accept the artist's counter-proposal

## Best Practices

### For Artists

**1. Be Realistic with Requirements**

Set requirements that are truly necessary for your performance. Venues are more likely to accept reasonable riders. If 80% of venues reject a requirement, consider if it's essential.

**2. Organize Requirements Logically**

Group related requirements together. For example, if you need specific microphone types, explain why in the additional notes. This helps venues understand your needs.

**3. Provide Clear Descriptions**

Instead of just "PA System Required: Yes", add context: "Professional PA system with minimum 2000W output for 500+ capacity venues"

**4. Create Multiple Riders for Different Situations**

Have different riders for:
- Small intimate venues
- Medium clubs and bars
- Large festivals and corporate events
- Outdoor performances

**5. Monitor Your Analytics**

Review your Rider Analytics monthly to understand what venues struggle with. Use this data to optimize your riders.

**6. Respond Quickly to Modifications**

Venues appreciate quick responses. Try to respond to modification proposals within 24 hours.

**7. Use the PDF Export for Professional Sharing**

When sharing riders outside the platform, use the PDF export to maintain professional formatting.

### For Venues

**1. Review Riders Before Booking**

Always use the Rider Comparison Tool to understand requirements before submitting a booking request. This prevents surprises later.

**2. Be Honest About Your Capabilities**

If you can't meet a requirement, propose a modification early rather than trying to work around it later.

**3. Provide Reasoning for Modifications**

When proposing changes, explain why you can't meet the requirement. Artists are more likely to work with you if they understand your constraints.

**4. Communicate Early**

If you see potential conflicts, send a message to the artist before or immediately after booking. Don't wait for the formal acknowledgment process.

**5. Document Agreements**

Keep records of what was agreed upon, especially if modifications were made. This prevents disputes later.

**6. Respond Promptly to Counter-Proposals**

Don't leave negotiations hanging. Respond to artist counter-proposals within 24-48 hours.

**7. Confirm Final Requirements**

Before the event, send a final confirmation message to the artist confirming all agreed-upon requirements.

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What if an artist doesn't have any riders?**

A: If an artist hasn't created riders, you can still book them. However, you won't have clarity on their requirements. We recommend asking the artist to create a rider before confirming the booking, or discussing requirements directly through the booking chat.

**Q: Can I modify a rider after it's been acknowledged?**

A: Yes. Even after initial acknowledgment, you can propose new modifications. The artist will receive a notification and can respond to the new changes.

**Q: How long does the modification process take?**

A: Most modifications are resolved within 1-3 days. However, this depends on how quickly both parties respond. You can always send a message through the booking chat to speed up the process.

**Q: What if we can't agree on a modification?**

A: If you reach an impasse, you have a few options:
1. Continue negotiating through counter-proposals
2. Request a different rider from the artist
3. Contact Ologywood support for mediation
4. Cancel the booking if agreement cannot be reached

### For Artists

**Q: How many riders can I create?**

A: You can create unlimited riders. However, we recommend keeping it to 3-5 main templates to avoid overwhelming venues.

**Q: Can I update a rider after it's been shared with a venue?**

A: Yes, but be careful. If you modify a rider that's already been shared, the venue will see the changes. We recommend creating a new version instead of modifying an existing one.

**Q: What if a venue keeps rejecting my modifications?**

A: This might indicate your requirement is unrealistic for that venue. Consider:
1. Proposing a compromise
2. Offering an alternative solution
3. Selecting a different rider that's less demanding
4. Declining the booking if the requirement is non-negotiable

**Q: How do I know if my riders are good?**

A: Check your Rider Analytics dashboard. A good rider should have:
- 70%+ acknowledgment rate without modifications
- Few repeated modification requests
- Positive feedback from venues

### For Venues

**Q: What if I accidentally select the wrong rider?**

A: Contact the artist immediately through the booking chat. Explain the mistake and ask them to confirm the correct rider. You can then propose modifications if needed.

**Q: Can I compare riders from different artists?**

A: The Rider Comparison Tool only compares riders from the same artist. To compare artists' requirements, you'll need to review each artist's riders separately.

**Q: What if the artist's rider has a typo or error?**

A: Propose a modification explaining the error. The artist will see your feedback and can correct it. You can also contact the artist directly through the booking chat.

**Q: How do I know if I can meet all requirements?**

A: Use the Rider Comparison Tool to review all requirements before booking. If you're unsure about any requirement, propose a modification or ask the artist for clarification.
